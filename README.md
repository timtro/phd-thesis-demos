# `ct-control-program-cpp`

Expository code examples to appear in my PhD thesis. The code here is meant to
be interesting and demonstrative, but not useful for anything in the real world.
Rather, it is a prelude to practical code that arises from the reasoning laid
out in these examples phrased in `TEST_CASES`.
